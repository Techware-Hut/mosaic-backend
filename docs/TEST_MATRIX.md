# Test Matrix

Maps backend features to automated tests (`npm test`), manual smoke checks, and proof-pack evidence.

**Runner:** `npm test` → `node --test tests/**/*.test.js` (123 tests, Node built-in runner)

**Test style:** Unit/integration-style tests with mocked Mongoose models and module hooks. They prove **handler logic and wiring** — not full end-to-end flows against live MongoDB, Stripe, or AWS in CI.

**Related:** [production-smoke-checklist.md](production-smoke-checklist.md), [PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md](PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md), [production-proof-pack-template.md](production-proof-pack-template.md), [STRIPE_WEBHOOKS.md](STRIPE_WEBHOOKS.md)

## Coverage summary

| Layer | Count | What it validates |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Automated (`tests/`) | **123** | DTOs, middleware, controller logic, webhook wiring, search filters, vendor listing/order/stock (mocked) |
| Manual smoke script | 1 | Live API + DB auth/check per role |
| Production smoke tiers | P0–P6 | Post-deploy on `https://api.mosaicbizhub.com` |
| Proof pack | Per release | Redacted evidence matrix |

**Not covered by automation:** Live Stripe payments, S3 uploads, email delivery, full order checkout, admin finalize against real DB, CI pipeline (none in repo).

## Manual QA still requiring human verification

These launch-critical areas have **no** meaningful automated coverage. They require human execution each release (or per [PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md](PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md) scope).

| Area | Why manual | Smoke IDs | Proof-pack field |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Deployed commit on EB** | Tests do not deploy or verify SHA | Runbook gate | EB deployed commit confirmed |
| **Live Stripe payments** | No test hits Stripe API | P2.3, P4.2–P4.4, P5.3 | Stripe Dashboard screenshot (redacted) |
| **Email delivery** | Mailer mocked in all tests | P1.1–P1.2, P2.3, P3.4 | Optional: inbox check note |
| **S3 presigned upload** | AWS SDK mocked | P2.6 | Manual upload + URL in draft |
| **Google OAuth E2E** | Redirect flow not automated | P1.8 | OAuth callback success note |
| **Connect onboarding** | No Connect tests | P5.1 | Connect status in Dashboard |
| **Subscription billing E2E** | Webhook logic mocked | P4.3 | Invoice payment delivery |
| **Order checkout E2E** | Order controller not tested | P5.2–P5.5 | Test order `paymentStatus: paid` |
| **Admin finalize + emails** | Controller not tested | P3.4 | Approval/rejection email received |
| **Frontend integration** | Backend tests only | Script + P6 | `verify-auth-check-smoke.js` page loads |
| **Cross-domain cookies** | Cookie helper unit-tested only | P1.4 | Browser session on `app.mosaicbizhub.com` |
| **Open P0 blockers** | Documented gaps, not tested | Launch review | [launch-readiness-report.md](launch-readiness-report.md) §9 |

### Manual smoke script (not `npm test`)

| Script | Command | What It Proves | What It Does Not Prove |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Auth smoke | `node scripts/verify-auth-check-smoke.js` | Live `/auth/check` per role; unauth 401; optional frontend page HTTP status | Full register/login flow; does not replace P1 tier |

Requires `.env`, MongoDB with seeded users per role, and running API (local or `API_BASE_URL`).

### Production negative probes (safe, no secrets)

Unsigned webhook POST → expect `400` on all five routes. Commands in [STRIPE_WEBHOOKS.md](STRIPE_WEBHOOKS.md). Record in proof pack as P4.5 evidence.

## How to run

```bash
# All automated tests (123)
npm test

# Manual auth smoke (live API + DB)
node scripts/verify-auth-check-smoke.js

# Production health (post-deploy)
# See production-smoke-checklist.md Tier 0
```

## Proof-pack evidence mapping

| Evidence type | Source | Automated equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm test` 123/123 pass | Pre-merge local/CI | Yes — full suite (see [MVP_BACKEND_PROGRAM_STATUS.md](MVP_BACKEND_PROGRAM_STATUS.md) for prod vs branch) |
| Auth smoke script output | `scripts/verify-auth-check-smoke.js` | Partial — live auth/check only |
| Smoke matrix P0–P6 | [production-smoke-checklist.md](production-smoke-checklist.md) | No — human execution |
| Webhook unsigned 400 | [STRIPE_WEBHOOKS.md](STRIPE_WEBHOOKS.md) curl | Partial — 9 tests cover handler logic |
| Stripe Dashboard deliveries | Manual | No |
| EB commit SHA | Deployment owner | No |

**Do not overclaim:** Passing `npm test` proves code-level contracts and wiring with mocks. It does **not** prove production deploy health, live payments, or launch readiness. See [PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md](PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md) for Deploy Go vs launch sign-off.
